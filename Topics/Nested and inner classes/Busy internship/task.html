<h2>Busy internship</h2>
<html><body><p>Below, you can see two classes: the outer class <code class="java">Intern</code> and the nested class <code class="java">Salary</code>. Every intern works at least 20 hours a week (the <code class="java">baseWorkload</code> for interns in the company) and gets the <code class="java">basePay</code> of 50 units for it. For each extra hour a week, the intern gets the <code class="java">extraHoursPay</code> of 2.8 units. Thus, an intern working 20 hours a week will get the base salary of 50 units, and an intern working 40 hours a week will get 106 units.</p>
<p>Complete the line of code for the <code class="java">weeklySalary</code> property computation based on these rules.</p></body></html><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>
